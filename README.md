## General Introduction

Welcome to **Nobly Harsh Reviews**, the digital redoubt where Sir Reginald Pique, armed with his relentless wit and unwavering standards, dispenses his cinema critiques. This application, crafted with the elegance of Svelte 5 preview and styled by the sophisticated simplicity of Tailwind CSS, brings a cinematic critique experience like no other. Using Redis from Upstash for persistent storage, the TMDB API for fetching extensive movie details, and ChatGPT to channel the ineffable essence of Sir Reginald Pique (whose existence remains as mysterious as a well-crafted plot twist), this project is a technophile's delight wrapped in a criticâ€™s robe.

## Requirements

Before you embark on this noble quest of film criticism, ensure you have the following installed:

- **NPM**: Essential for managing the packages that Sir Reginald would deign to acknowledge.

You will also need these tokens / API keys, securely tucked in your environment:

# Redis connection (because even Sir Reginald appreciates a good cache)
# https://upstash.com/docs/redis/howto/connectwithupstashredis
REDIS_TOKEN=<upstash redis token>
# TMDB for when Sir Reginald needs to fact-check his disdain
# https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started
TMDB_TOKEN=<tmdb token>
# OpenAI because sometimes, even Sir Reginald needs a prompt
# https://platform.openai.com
OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai api key>
```

## Run
